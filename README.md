## 📝 Overview
Hydrogen Atlas is an interactive map platform that brings all hydrogen assets, renewables, and demand centers onto one screen—so anyone can find the best location or corridor for new hydrogen projects.


## ✨ Features

- 🌐 Interactive map of plants, storages, pipelines, hubs, ports
- 🔀 Layer toggles: wind/solar zones, demand centers, transport & regulations
- ⚡ Automated site/corridor recommendations
- 📊 KPI dashboard for cost comparisons
- 📦 Export maps, rankings, and reports in one click

## 🛑 Problem Statement

| Challenge      | Description                                                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data silos     | Hydrogen asset info is scattered—making planning inefficient.    |
| Duplication    | Projects get built with little coordination, wasting resources.  |
| No Decision Tool | No easy map or optimizer for comparing sites and routes.       |


## 🛠️ Solution

- Unified web map with all infrastructure, renewables, demand, and zoning data.
- Geospatial optimization engine for site and corridor ranking.
- Exportable outputs for easy reporting, investment, and permitting.


## 👥 Users & Stakeholders

| User Type           | Role                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Urban Planners      | Zoning, corridor selection           |
| Developers          | Site analysis, build sequencing      |
| Policy Analysts     | Incentive alignment, gap ID          |
| Investors           | Investment screening, KPIs           |


## 🌍 Impact

- 💸 Smarter capital deployment for high-yield projects
